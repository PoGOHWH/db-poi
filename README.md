# iitc-pogo-json

This JSON file is an export from the [PoGO-S2](https://gitlab.com/AlfonsoML/pogo-s2) plugin from [IITC](https://iitc.me/). To setup both, refer to their respective resources.

## Usage

Just import the JSON file from the PoGO Actions menu added to IITC by PoGO-S2.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you have data you've marked yourself, be sure to export it to a separate file first!

## Contribution

If you would like to contribute updates and additions:

1. Please download the latest version of the [JSON](https://github.com/PoGOHWH/db-poi/blob/master/poi.json) and do a fresh import before starting work.
2. Make your changes, and export the file.
3. Fork this repository and commit your export explaining what it does.
  - Yes, you can just overwrite the formatted JSON with the one-line soup that the plugin exports. The GitHub Actions will take care of making it legible once it gets to this repo.
4. Send us a pull request! :D
